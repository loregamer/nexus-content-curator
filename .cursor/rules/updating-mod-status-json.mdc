# Updating Mod Status JSON

## Format Overview

The `mod-status.json` file contains three main sections:

- `Mod Statuses`: Lists mod IDs by game and status category
- `Mod Descriptors`: Contains detailed information about each mod
- `Keyword Rules`: Contains pattern-based rules for specific games

## Adding/Updating a Mod Status

When you have a mod status update in this format:

```
Game Shortname: <game>
Mod ID: <id>
Status: <status>
Reason: <reason>
Alternative: <alternative_url>
```

Follow these steps to update the JSON:

1. First, add/update the mod ID in the appropriate status category under `Mod Statuses`:

   ```json
   {
     "Mod Statuses": {
       "<game>": {
         "<STATUS>": ["<id>", ...]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Then, add/update the mod's descriptor information:
   ```json
   {
     "Mod Descriptors": {
       "<game>": {
         "<id>": {
           "reason": "<reason>",
           "alternative": "<alternative_url or null>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Status Categories

Available status categories:

- `BROKEN`: For mods that are non-functional or cause serious issues
- `LAME`: For mods that are poorly implemented or have significant drawbacks
- `ABANDONED`: For mods that are no longer maintained
- `CAUTION`: For mods that require special attention or have minor issues
- `INFORMATIVE`: For mods that need important usage notes

## Example

For this mod status:

```
Game Shortname: baldursgate3
Mod ID: 2518
Status: BROKEN
Reason: Abandoned and broken. Use Sit This One Out 2 instead.
Alternative: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6183
```

The JSON updates would be:

1. Add to `Mod Statuses`:

```json
{
  "Mod Statuses": {
    "baldursgate3": {
      "BROKEN": ["2518", ...]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Add to `Mod Descriptors`:

```json
{
  "Mod Descriptors": {
    "baldursgate3": {
      "2518": {
        "reason": "Abandoned and broken. Use Sit This One Out 2 instead.",
        "alternative": "https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6183"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

1. Always maintain proper JSON formatting
2. Keep mod IDs as strings (with quotes)
3. If there's no alternative URL, use `null` instead
4. Ensure the game shortname matches existing entries
5. Make sure the status category is in ALL CAPS
6. Line breaks in reason text should be encoded as "\n" in the JSON
7. Backup the JSON file before making changes

## Validation

After updating the JSON:

1. Verify the JSON is valid using a JSON validator
2. Check that the mod ID appears in both `Mod Statuses` and `Mod Descriptors`
3. Ensure all required fields are present
4. Verify the status category exists in the file
