[size=150][b][color=#FE545D] Why I Made This [/color][/b][/size]
Nexus Mods and its moderation is [b]horrible[/b]. Enforced positivity and author-set permission policies has been [b]disastrous[/b]. My hope is that by maintaining this tool, we will truly realize how rampant this issue is and the [b]necessity[/b] for ModHQ.

It's just us, bros. Every other modding community is [size=150][b]COMPROMISED[/b][/size].

You will now know if mods are:
[list]
[*] [b]broken[/b]
[*] whether or not an author is worth [b]engaging[/b] in
[*] if the mod author was stingy with their permission policy
[*] Viable alternatives to the mods you are visiting
[*] [size=85]etc.[/size]

When you click it, it will open this thread and you can paste your clipboard. Post it and I will then review it and add it to the database.
